# ============================================================
# PERSONAL FINANCE APP — Built with Streamlit
# ============================================================
# Streamlit is a Python library that turns Python scripts
# into beautiful web apps — no HTML or JavaScript needed!
#
# Every time the user moves a slider or types a number,
# Streamlit re-runs the whole script from top to bottom.
# This is how the app stays "live" and reactive.
# ============================================================

# --- IMPORTS ---
# streamlit  → the web app framework (pip install streamlit)
# math       → built-in Python library for math functions
import streamlit as st
import math


# ============================================================
# PAGE CONFIGURATION
# st.set_page_config() must be the VERY FIRST Streamlit command.
# It sets the browser tab title, icon, and layout width.
# layout="wide" uses the full screen width — good for finance apps
# ============================================================
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Personal Finance App",
    page_icon="💰",
    layout="wide"
)


# ============================================================
# CUSTOM CSS STYLING
# st.markdown() lets us inject raw HTML or CSS into the page.
# unsafe_allow_html=True is required to render actual HTML.
# We use this to make the app look polished and professional.

        <strong>The lesson that changes everything:</strong><br><br>
        You personally put in <strong>{format_currency(total_invested)}</strong> over {years} years.<br>
        The market handed you an extra <strong>{format_currency(interest_earned)}</strong> for free.<br>
        You ended up with <strong>{format_currency(future_value)}</strong> — that's <strong>{money_multiplier:.1f}x</strong> your money.<br><br>
        The secret? <strong>Compound interest.</strong> Your money earns interest.
        Then that interest earns interest. Then THAT earns interest.
        The longer you leave it alone, the faster it snowballs.<br><br>
        Start early. Stay consistent. Never stop.
